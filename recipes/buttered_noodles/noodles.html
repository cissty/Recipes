    <h1>Buttered Noodles</h1>
    <img src="noodles.webp" alt="buttered noodles">
    <p>Saucy, buttered noodles are simple to make and perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs. Butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper are all you need for this quick and easy, kid-friendly dish, although fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor. It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.</p>

    <h2>Buttered Noodles Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Believe it or not, you can make this incredibly simple dish with just four ingredients:</p>

    <p><strong>Noodles </strong>This recipe calls for fettuccine noodles, but you could use any noodles you have on hand, from penne to spaghetti.</p>
    <p><strong>Butter </strong>You can use salted or unsalted butter. Since you'll add more salt at the end, you might want to opt for unsalted (depending on your taste, of course).</p>
    <p><strong>Parmesan </strong>Grated Parmesan cheese takes this dish up a notch. Buttered noodles don't technically require cheese, so you can leave it out if you want.</p>
    <p><strong>Salt and Pepper </strong>Finish off this easy buttered noodles recipe with salt and ground black pepper.</p>
